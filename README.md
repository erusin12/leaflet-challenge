# leaflet-challenge
 challenge-15
This challenge provided us starter files in order to create a leaflet map of earthquake data.  This map has earthquake data obtained from an API and then maps the points based on the latitude and longitute.  Next, we used a different color based on the depth of the earthquake and the size of the marker was based on the magnitutde of the earthquake.  I made it so the map would open up the the US at a similar zoom as the example, though we have the ability to move around the world.

I used internet resources and prior class examples to create this project.
